## Keybinds: **DWM** Inspired
My keybinds (see [i3 config](https://github.com/dillacorn/dotfiles/blob/main/config/i3/config)) are heavily influenced by [**suckless DWM**](https://dwm.suckless.org/). I previously used [**DWM Flexipatch**](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch) by [bakkeby](https://github.com/bakkeby) â€” DWM was my first window manager.

## i3 Themes Change Script

You can dynamically switch i3 themes using **Rofi**.

1. Navigate to your themes folder:
   ```sh
   cd ~/.config/i3/themes
   chmod +x *
   ```
2. Use the keybind `mod4+shift+t` to trigger the Rofi theme selector.

Enjoy! I scripted this myself!

## i3 Keybind Custom Scripts/Commands

Here are some of my custom keybinds from the i3 configuration:

- `mod4+shift+q` = **Reload i3 config**  
  - Reloads the current i3 configuration to apply any changes.
  - Additionally randomizes wallpaper in `~/Pictures/wallpapers` directory. <- if you don't want this behavior modify the ([i3 config](https://github.com/dillacorn/dotfiles/blob/main/config/i3/config))
  
- `mod4+shift+r` = **Rotate i3 mod navigation**  
  - Switches between `mod1(alt)` and `mod4(win/super)` navigation using a script: [rotate_config_navigation.sh](https://github.com/dillacorn/dotfiles/blob/main/config/i3/scripts/rotate_config_navigation.sh).
  
- `mod4+shift+g` = **Capture a GIF**  
  - Starts a GIF recording with the script: [gif.sh](https://github.com/dillacorn/dotfiles/blob/main/config/i3/scripts/gif.sh).  
  - **Repeat the keybind to finish recording!**
  - `gif_date_time.gif` saved in `~/Videos` directory
  
- `mod4+shift+s` = **Scrot screenshot**  
  - Takes a screenshot using Scrot.
  - `date_time.jpg` saved in `~/Pictures` directory

- `mod4+ctrl+shift+s` = **Flameshot screenshot**  
  - Takes a screenshot using Flameshot with more customization options.
  - `date_time.png` normally saved in `~/Pictures` directory

## i3 Navigation

Here are more example keybinds from my i3 config:

Let me preface `"mod"` can equal `"mod1"` and/or `"mod4"` depending on [script navigation rotation](https://github.com/dillacorn/dotfiles/blob/main/config/i3/scripts/rotate_config_navigation.sh)

- `mod+shift+enter` = **Open Terminal**
  - Launches the terminal (default: Alacritty).

- `mod+p` = **Rofi Application Launcher**
  - Opens the Rofi app launcher for quick access to applications.

- `mod4+ctrl+shift+l` = **Lock Screen**
  - Locks the screen using `i3lock`.

- `mod+shift+c` = **Close Window**
  - Closes the focused window.

- `mod+f` = **Toggle Floating**
  - Toggles between tiling and floating window layouts.

- `mod+shift+f` = **Toggle Fullscreen**
  - Toggles app focus ~ fullscreen.

- `mod+arrow_keys` = **Change Focus**
  - Switch between open windows.

- `mod+shift+arrow_keys` = **Move Windows**
  - Move window location within workspace.

- `mod+mouse_1` = **Move Floating Window**
  - Move Floating Window with your mouse.

- `mod+mouse_2` = **Resize Floating Window**
  - Resize Floating Window with your mouse.

- `mod+1` to `mod+9` = **Workspace Switching**  
  - Switches to workspaces 1 through 9.

- `mod+shift+1` to `mod+shift+9` = **Move Focused Window to Workspace**  
  - Moves the currently focused window to the specified workspace.

## TTY Setup: Ditch the Display Manager

I prefer using **TTY** instead of display managers like `gdm3`, `sddm`, or `lightdm`. To remove your display manager:

```sh
sudo apt remove gdm3 sddm lightdm
```

To login, type your username and password in TTY, then start i3 manually:

1. **Edit xinitrc**:
   ```sh
   micro /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
   ```
   Match my [xinitrc](https://github.com/dillacorn/dotfiles/blob/main/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc).

2. **Start i3**:
   ```sh
   startx
   ```

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   If you encounter any issues, switch between TTYs using `CTRL+ALT+F1` to `F6`.

### Why I Prefer TTY:
When you logout of i3, any errors in your config or applications will be shown directly in the **TTY**, making it easier to troubleshoot.

## i3 Apps and Manual Scripts Install/Setup

To install the applications I use with i3, run my [install script](https://github.com/dillacorn/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/install_my_i3_apps.sh). This includes i3wm, Rofi, Dunst, and others.

Make sure your i3 scripts are executable:
```sh
cd ~/.config/i3
chmod +x rotate_configs.sh i3exit.sh custom_res.sh
```

### P.S.
This originally started as a Wayland repo (see git history) ~ X11 currently is generally more flexible in customization.. I'm assuming if I learn to do as much as I can on X11 then I can maybe eventually transfer that knowledge to a seperate repo that will be using Swaywm. 

Currently i3 to my knowledge is more flexible (especially for gaming) but the continued knowledge and updates in the unstable repo have proven that the gap will close eventually and we may all need to move to a wayland based window manager.
